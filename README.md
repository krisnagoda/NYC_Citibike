# NYC_Citibike

## Overview
Exploratory analysis of the NYC Citibike bike-sharing program data, focused on gaining insight that may inform viability of similar programs in new locations. In this instance we have an investor interested in funding a new bike-sharing program in Des Moines, IA. 

## Results
Here are the insights and data visualizations from included Tableau Story.

Nearly half or 49% of all rides only last 10 minutes or less; with a peak duration of 5 minutes. And rider behavior looks consistent across Male, Female, and Unknown genders.

Customer behavior varies between weekdays and weekends. On weekdays, we have two events with one peaking at 8AM and the other at 5PM, with softness Wednesday afternoon. On weekends, we have a single event each day with a more gradual build and decline.

Population density, points of interest, and Iâ€™m assuming weather drive usage of the NYC Citibike bikeshare program.
